# Junior-Year-Engineering-Project-Paddle-Boat-Propulsion-System-with-User-Interface-Integration
This was my Junior year project of my Undergraduate Degree. The basic over view of the project is as follows: I was assigned to a team of 5 engineers, 4 mechanical and 1 electrical engineer (myself). We were tasking with designing and fabricating a propulsion system for a paddle boat!
