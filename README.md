# Junior-Year-Engineering-Project-Paddle-Boat-Propulsion-System-with-User-Interface-Integration
This was my Junior year project of my Undergraduate Degree. The basic over view of the project is as follows: I was assigned to a team of 5 engineers, 4 Mechanical and 1 Electrical Engineer (myself). We were tasking with designing and fabricating a propulsion system for a paddle boat!  
I was tasked with designing a Brushless DC motor and worked alongside a Mechanical Engineer to fabricate the motor. Along with motor design, other responsibilites included design and implementation of the user-interface. I used an Arduino-Uno-R3 as the controller for reading sensor values and displaing information to the LCD displays. The MSP-430 Launchpad was used to control the speeed of the motor. I was tasked with incorporating 3 sensors, I used a RTD alongside a PT100 amplifier for measure motor temperature. A simple voltage divider circuit was used for accuratley measuring the voltage of the batteries. A magnetic-encoder was used for measuring the revolutions of the shaft of the motor. Two analog digital-encoders: one for throttle, and one for steering of the rudder. Additional modules used include: servos for steering, buck converters for stepping down voltage, two 18 V, 4 amp-hour batteries, a 3.3 V enable switch, a 5.0 V enable switch, a master switch, and a BLDC motor controller.
